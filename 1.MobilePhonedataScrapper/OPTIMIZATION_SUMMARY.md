# Scraper Optimization Summary

## Performance Improvements

### ⚡ Dubizzle Scraper Optimizations

#### **Before:**
- Speed: **0.43 products/second**
- Workers: 15 parallel browsers
- Success rate: 106/131 (81%)
- Time for 131 products: 248.4 seconds
- Timeouts: 20s page load, 1s implicit wait
- Wait times: 1.5s (JS enabled), 0.3s (JS disabled)
- Retries: 2 attempts

#### **After Optimizations:**
- Workers: **20 parallel browsers** (+33%)
- Timeouts: **15s page load** (-25%), **0.5s implicit wait** (-50%)
- Wait times: **1.0s (JS)** (-33%), **0.2s (no JS)** (-33%)
- Retries: **3 attempts** (+50% retry chances)
- Retry delay: **0.2s** (instant retry on non-timeout errors)

#### **Expected Results:**
- **Target Speed: 1.0+ products/second** (130% faster)
- **Better success rate** (3 retries vs 2)
- **Time for 131 products: ~120 seconds** (50% faster)

### 🚀 Key Changes Made:

1. **Increased Parallelism**
   - `max_workers: 15 → 20` (+33% concurrency)
   
2. **Reduced Timeouts**
   - Page load: `20s → 15s` (-25%)
   - Implicit wait: `1s → 0.5s` (-50%)
   
3. **Optimized Wait Times**
   - JS enabled: `1.5s → 1.0s` (-33%)
   - JS disabled: `0.3s → 0.2s` (-33%)
   
4. **Smarter Retry Logic**
   - Retries: `2 → 3` attempts
   - Retry delay: `0.5s → 0.2s` (60% faster)
   - Skip retry on timeout errors (save time)
   
5. **Reduced Logging Spam**
   - Progress updates: every 20 products (was 10)
   - Silent retry failures (clean output)

### 📊 Performance Targets:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Speed** | 0.43 p/s | **1.0+ p/s** | **+130%** |
| **Workers** | 15 | **20** | **+33%** |
| **Page Load** | 20s | **15s** | **-25%** |
| **Wait (JS)** | 1.5s | **1.0s** | **-33%** |
| **Wait (No JS)** | 0.3s | **0.2s** | **-33%** |
| **Success Rate** | 81% | **85-90%** | **+5-10%** |

### 🔧 Technical Details:

**Dubizzle Scraper (`main.py`):**
- Uses Selenium with headless Chrome
- Two-phase approach: JS for listings, no-JS for products
- ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel browser instances
- Anti-bot detection with user agent + navigator spoofing
- Retry logic with exponential backoff on non-timeout errors
- HTML validation (>1000 chars) before accepting page

**MobileMasr Scraper (`main.py`):**
- Uses Algolia Search API (no Selenium needed)
- Pure async with aiohttp (20 concurrent requests)
- Speed: **400+ products/second** (instant API calls)
- Success rate: **100%** (direct API access)
- No bot protection issues

### 🎯 Recommendations:

1. **For Dubizzle:** Current optimizations should reach 1.0 p/s target
2. **For MobileMasr:** Already optimal at 400+ p/s
3. **Monitor:** Watch failed product count - if >15%, consider:
   - Increasing timeout to 20s
   - Reducing workers to 15
   - Adding random delays (0.1-0.3s) to avoid detection

### 📝 Usage:

```bash
# Dubizzle (Selenium-based)
cd DubbizleSrapper
uv run main.py

# MobileMasr (API-based)  
cd MobileMasrScrapper
uv run main.py
```

### ✅ Next Steps:

1. Test with 3-5 pages to verify 1.0+ p/s speed
2. Monitor success rate (should be 85-90%)
3. If failures >15%, adjust timeouts/workers
4. For production: Add rate limiting and error recovery
