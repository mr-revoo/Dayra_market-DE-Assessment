# Medallion Architecture for E-commerce Used Electronics Data Platform

## Overview

This data architecture implements the Medallion design pattern with three layers — Bronze, Silver, and Gold — optimized for an e-commerce used electronics business. It efficiently handles diverse streaming and batch data sources, progressively improving data quality and structure through each layer. This layered approach enables high-performance analytics, real-time monitoring, and machine learning applications, creating a robust foundation for business insights.

## Why Medallion Architecture?

You chose Medallion architecture because it provides a clear, scalable way to incrementally refine data quality and structure:

- **Data Quality & Governance:** By layering raw, cleansed, and curated data, you control data quality at each stage and prevent poor or malformed data from affecting analytics.
- **Reprocessing & Flexibility:** Bronze layer preserves immutable raw data allowing you to reprocess data anytime if business logic or data sources change.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Different teams can own ingestion, transformation, and analytics layers independently, improving collaboration and reducing bottlenecks.
- **Auditability & Lineage:** Full lineage is maintained from raw to business-ready data, which is critical for regulatory compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Scalability and Performance:** Each layer can be optimized for its specific workload—ingestion speed in Bronze, cleansing and enrichment in Silver, and query performance in Gold.

Medallion architecture is better suited than alternatives like Kappa for this business because it allows batch and streaming data to be harmonized with strong data governance and analytical readiness.

## Architecture Components and Rationale

### Data Sources

- **Streamed:** User activity logs, sales transactions, and AI pricing engine output require real-time ingestion for fresh insights and operational dashboards.
- **Batch:** Web scraping and manual market data arrive in batches and provide important context and competitive intelligence.

### Bronze Layer (Raw Data Storage)

- Chosen for durable, append-only storage of raw source data.
- Enables auditability, reprocessing, and data lineage.
- Retains full fidelity without transformation to support later schema evolution and troubleshooting.

### Silver Layer (Data Cleansing & Validation)

- Apache Spark handles scalable batch and stream transforms with micro-batching, ideal for deduplication, standardization, and enrichment.
- Pydantic ensures schema validation at ingestion, catching malformed data early.
- Great Expectations performs table-level quality checks post-transformation.
- Stores clean, standardized data enabling reliable downstream consumption.
  
### Gold Layer (Analytics-Ready Data)

- dbt formalizes business logic, modeling data into star schemas, aggregates, and marts optimized for Snowflake.
- Snowflake provides elastic, scalable MPP query execution, clustering, and features optimized for analytical workloads.
- Gold layer powers BI, operational reports, ML feature pipelines, and real-time dashboards.

### Orchestration and Monitoring

- Apache Airflow manages complex job dependencies, retries, and SLA enforcement.
- Monitoring pipelines with Prometheus-style metrics and alerting ensure reliability and visibility.

## Data Quality and Schema Evolution

- Pydantic: Light record-level schema validation on ingestion to prevent bad data entering Bronze.
- Great Expectations: Comprehensive post-transform validation ensures table quality, detects anomalies, and reports trends.
- Schema Registry: Ensures backward-compatible schema evolution for Kafka topics to avoid pipeline failures.
- Delta/Iceberg tables enable ACID transactional updates, schema changes, and time travel for data governance and reprocessing.

## Partitioning and Performance in Snowflake

- Partition fact tables by event date to enable partition pruning that optimizes query scans.
- Cluster on high-cardinality columns (customer_id, product_category) for join and filter performance.
- Employ incremental dbt models to reduce data scanned and computation needed.
- Use result caching, auto-scaling, and materialized views for cost-effective low-latency analytics.
